"""deep-code-review method.md is a core; the DIFF-only and bypass/probe lenses moved verbatim to method-diff.md and method-lenses.md.

Pins: every non-blank line of the pre-split method.md (43524 bytes, sha256 of the whole file
ebf9724444148579d64e13ef3c117110d96b1d6cdd32b66757204bf6dd403c58) survives in the core or a lazy file
(scripts/method-split-lines.txt holds the truncated sha256 of each old line; the four old lines cut mid-line are stored as
`old:head:tail` and both halves must be present as whole lines), each lazy file opens with "Read this when" and is routed by
path from the core and from full-map.md, the core names each trigger, each lens paragraph lives in exactly its own file, and the
core stays under a size cap that is a >=30% cut. Two old lines (the intent-conformance cites) were repointed to method-diff.md; their
fixture entries read `old:new` so the reworded line must survive whole.
