#!/usr/bin/env bash
# land_train.sh <base-sha> <union-sha> — land every PR of a GREEN merge-train union, each pinned to the
# head SHA the union proved. A PR whose head moved since the union is skipped, never merged unproven.
#
# The union is found BY COMMIT among UNION_DIRS (a rerun after dropping a culprit gets a new worktree
# name, so a name is not a handle). Members are read from the union's merge commits, subject
# "merge-train: #N" (what merge_train.py writes; override the number regex with PR_RE).
#
# Env: UNION_DIRS (required; space-separated worktree paths, or newline-separated when a path contains a space), BASE_BRANCH (default main), REMOTE
# (default origin), CHANGELOG_DIR (default changelog.d: a PR touching no file under it is appended to
# BACKFILL_FILE as a backfill list, not skipped), BACKFILL_FILE (default ./changelog_backfill.txt),
# PR_RE (sed -E regex with one group, default 'merge-train: #([0-9]+)'), GH (default gh),
# LAND_CMD (default: gh pr merge N --merge --match-head-commit SHA; run via bash -c with $1=N $2=SHA),
# Policy: github_actions=off adds [skip ci] to the default merge (see perun_policy.py).
# WAIT_TRIES/WAIT_SECS (mergeable=UNKNOWN retry, default 10 x 8s).
# Stacked children (open PRs based on a member's head branch) are retargeted to BASE_BRANCH before each merge.
# Refuses (skips) a PR whose base is not BASE_BRANCH. On every exit, linked worktrees in UNION_DIRS are removed
# (_clean_union.sh).
# Exit: 0 all landed or skipped-with-notice, 1 a merge command failed (see "FAILED rc=" lines), 2 usage/no union worktree.
